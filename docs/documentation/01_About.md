Sex-dimorphic mapping with sum of the single effects model (sdSuSiE) explicitly models sex differences in genetic effects while properly accounting for correlations between different types of genetic effects induced by LD and sample imbalance between sexes. It uses summary statistics from sex-stratified GWASs as inputs and extends the recent scalable variational inference algorithm SuSiE to fine-map sex-dimorphic effects.
